# Face Recognition Fraud Detection System

This repository contains the source code for a **Face Recognition Fraud Detection System** developed using Python. The project aims to identify fraudulent mobile connections by matching faces with varying user details (e.g., name and address) using face recognition technology. It is designed to process large datasets and efficiently compare millions of subscriber records.

## Overview

The system leverages the Python face recognition library to detect potential fraud by matching faces in mobile subscriber records. This helps identify cases where individuals use different names and addresses but the same facial identity, ensuring the integrity of telecom databases.

### Key Features
- **Face Recognition**: Utilizes a face recognition API to detect and compare faces across multiple records.
- **Large-Scale Data Processing**: Optimized to handle up to 30 million records efficiently.
- **Fraud Detection**: Flags discrepancies where the same face appears with different user details, such as names and addresses.

## Files

- **FacesComparator.py**: Core script that handles face detection and comparison across the subscriber dataset.
- **ImageEncoder.py**: For encoding the images of faces of subscribers for facial matching.
- **TestFaceComparision.py**: For testing the script with few samples.
- **Utils.py**: Contains common utility functions.
- **README.md**: (This file) Provides an overview of the project and its structure.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/himanjim/FaceRecognition.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Dataset**:
   Ensure the subscriber data is formatted correctly and ready for processing.

4. **Run the System**:
   Execute the `FacesComparator.py` script to start detecting fraudulent records:
   ```bash
   python FacesComparator.py
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- face_recognition library
- Pandas, NumPy for data handling
- Required libraries in `requirements.txt`
